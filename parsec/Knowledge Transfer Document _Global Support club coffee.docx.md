# Timelines & Process of Handover to Support

Essentially the Project team decides on the duration of hyper care support to Origins depending upon the system/ user’s stability and usage. During Hyper care, support team members shall be involved, and they would travel to the origin and understand the business process, user comfort etc. Project teams shall inform support team 2-3 month in advance for hyper care support. During this phase, the process KT shall start to the support team member and support team member would be shadowing the project consultant. On completion of knowledge transfer and complete documentation, project consultant would shadow the support consultant for a duration where user comfort levels could be determined. Few Indicators for Stabilization- Outstanding Issues proportion, completion of major program changes, Absence of backend table updates. The formal transition happens after the joint call with the business is done and the support process is intimated to origins.
